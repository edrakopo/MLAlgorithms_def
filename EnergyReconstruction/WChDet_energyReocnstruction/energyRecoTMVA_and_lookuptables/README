To train a new BDTG:

> root -l
> .x TMVARegression.C

This creates a weight file which is stored at: weights/

You can create the tree for the BDTG input with: Energy_studies_recoquant_iNUM.C 

In order to reconstruct the energy:

* If you have not trained your own BDTG 
> mkdir weights/
and copy TMVARegression_BDTG.weights.xml there.

> root -l
> .x TMVARegressionApplication.C

This will create a .root file with histograms. The reconstructed energy is stored at the histogram named "BDTG".
